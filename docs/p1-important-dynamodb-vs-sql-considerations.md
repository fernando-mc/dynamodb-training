# Important DynamoDB vs. SQL Considerations

## When to use DynamoDB

DynamoDB is excellent for applications with:

- Large amounts of data
- Strict latency requirements
- Knowable access patterns

## When to consider not using DynamoDB 

- Your team has extensive SQL experience and doesn't have time to learn a very different tool
- Your access patterns are likely to change drastically over time

With this all said, later on we'll look at how you can start to model your access patterns. That process should help you start to see if DynamoDB is a good option for you.
