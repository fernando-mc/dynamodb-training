# Important DynamoDB vs. SQL Considerations

## When to use DynamoDB

DynamoDB is excellent for applications with:

- Large amounts of data
- Strict latency requirements
- Known access patterns
- 

Data sets with simple, known access patterns. If you're generating recommendations and serving them to users, DynamoDB's simple key-value access patterns make it a fast, reliable choice.


	You can assess accesses patterns beforehand
	Design overhead
	Improved performance and cost
